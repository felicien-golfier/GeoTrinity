# Ability Bar HUD — abilities, cooldowns & deployable counts

## Context
The player HUD shows health/ammo/shield and a boss bar, but nothing tells the player **what abilities they have, which are on cooldown, and how many deployables remain**. Goal: a single compact row of icons at the **bottom-center** of the screen, one slot per granted (non-passive) player ability, each showing:
- the ability icon,
- a radial cooldown sweep + countdown number while on cooldown,
- (deployable abilities only) a remaining-count badge.

The data already exists: `UAbilityInfo` holds icons/input/tags, GAS exposes cooldown remaining/duration per ability, and `UGeoDeployableManagerComponent` broadcasts deploy count. So this is a thin C++ data-gathering layer on `AGeoHUD` plus a UMG ability-bar widget (BP), following the project's "screen-space UI = BP event forwarded from HUD" convention.

**Decisions:** Hybrid (C++ data, BP layout) · radial sweep + seconds text · event-driven + light tick only while a cooldown is active.

## Design overview
```
APlayableCharacter (granted ability specs + DeployableManagerComponent)
        │
AGeoHUD ── GetAbilityBarEntries()  → TArray<FGeoAbilityBarEntry>  (icon, tags, isDeployable)
        ├─ InitAbilityBar() / RefreshAbilityBar() BP events   (build slots)
        └─ OnPlayerDeployCountChanged delegate                (refresh count badges)
        │
WBP_AbilityBar (UGeoUserWidget) ── HorizontalBox of WBP_AbilitySlot
WBP_AbilitySlot ── Image(icon) + radial-fill material + countdown Text + count Text
        └─ Tick: only while on cooldown / deployable → query HUD helper
```

## C++ changes

### 1. Entry struct + gather helpers — `AGeoHUD` (`GeoHUD.h/.cpp`)
```cpp
USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct FGeoAbilityBarEntry
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) FGameplayTag AbilityTag;
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) FGameplayTag InputTag;
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) TObjectPtr<UTexture2D const> Icon = nullptr;
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly) bool bIsDeployable = false;
};
```
Add to `AGeoHUD`:
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) TArray<FGeoAbilityBarEntry> GetAbilityBarEntries() const;`
  - From `HudPlayerParams.GetGeoAbilitySystemComponent()`, iterate `GetActivatableAbilities()`; for each spec get the `UGeoGameplayAbility` CDO → `GetAbilityTag()`.
  - Skip passives (`UGeoGameplayAbility::IsPassive()`).
  - Match the global `UAbilityInfo` entry by tag (`GetAbilitiesForClass(PlayerClass)` / `GetAllPlayersAbilityInfos`) → pull `AbilityIcon`, `InputTag`, and the new `bShowDeployCount` → `bIsDeployable`.
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure) void GetAbilityCooldown(FGameplayTag AbilityTag, float& OutRemaining, float& OutDuration) const;`
  - Find granted spec by tag; call native `Spec.Ability->GetCooldownTimeRemainingAndDuration(ActorInfo, OutRemaining, OutDuration)`.
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure) void GetDeployCountForAbility(FGameplayTag AbilityTag, int32& OutCurrent, int32& OutMax) const;`
  - Resolve the deployable class for the ability; read avatar's `UGeoDeployableManagerComponent` (`GetComponentByClass`): live count from `GetDeployables<AGeoDeployableBase>()` filtered by class vs. slot cap / `GetMaxDeployables()`.

### 2. BP-facing wiring on `AGeoHUD`
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent) void InitAbilityBar();` — implemented in HUD BP, forwards to the overlay's ability-bar widget which calls `GetAbilityBarEntries()` and builds slots. Call from `InitOverlay()` after abilities are granted.
- `UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent) void RefreshAbilityBar();` — rebuild after class change.
- `UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable) FOnDeployCountChanged OnPlayerDeployCountChanged;` (reuse signature from `GeoDeployableManagerComponent.h`). In `BindCallbacksToDependencies()`, find the avatar's `UGeoDeployableManagerComponent` and bind its `OnDeployCountChanged` → re-broadcast so BP count badges refresh without polling.

### 3. `FPlayersGameplayAbilityInfo` — `AbilityInfo.h`
Add `UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadOnly, Category="Cosmetic") bool bShowDeployCount = false;` so designers explicitly flag Mine/Turret deploy abilities. `GetAbilityBarEntries()` copies it into `FGeoAbilityBarEntry::bIsDeployable`.

### 4. Class switching — `PlayableCharacter.cpp`
`ChangeClass()` clears/re-grants abilities, so the bar must rebuild. After abilities are re-granted, reach the HUD (via `GetGeoPlayerController()`) and call `RefreshAbilityBar()`.

## Editor automation (MCP / Python) — corrected per `AI/MCP/*`
ALWAYS read `AI/MCP/CLAUDE.md` (+ `MCP_UI.md`, `MCP_Material.md`) before this work. Key constraints these docs impose, which change the approach:

- **Python cannot read/write a widget designer tree** (`MCP_UI.md`). Any multi-element slot layout must be built by a C++ `UEditorUtilityObject` shim — extend the existing `UGeoWidgetBuilderUtil` (`Source/GeoTrinity/Public/Tool/GeoWidgetBuilderUtil.h/.cpp`), which already owns `BeginBuild`/`FinishBuild` (validate → clear root → compile → save) and a `HorizontalBox`-free image/canvas pattern. Adding a new `UFUNCTION` to a shim **requires a full build with the editor closed** (`MCP/CLAUDE.md`).
- **No `M_CooldownRadial` with an `If` node** — `MaterialExpressionIf` scalar constants aren't Python-settable (`MCP_Material.md`). Reuse the existing **hard-edge fill pattern** (`Step`-based) from `M_ZoneIndicator` / `M_HealingZone` (`FillPercent` / `DurationPercent` scalar). For a *radial sweep* the same approach applies but compare the pixel's **angle** (`atan2(uvn.y, uvn.x)` normalized to 0..1) against the `Fill` scalar via `Step` — pixel-perfect, no blur, no `If`.
- **Naming/location** (`MCP_UI.md`): `WBP_` prefix, assets under `/Game/HUD/`. Widget names passed to `ConstructWidget` become the `BindWidget` variable names — match them in the C++/BP widget class.

### Steps
1. **Material `M_CooldownSweep`** (`/Game/HUD/`, Python via `MaterialEditingLibrary`, `MCP_Material.md` pattern): Unlit + Masked; `ScalarParameter "Fill"` (0 = ready/icon clear, 1 = fully swept) driving a `Step` over normalized angle. One `MaterialInstanceDynamic` per slot at runtime.
2. **Shim functions on `UGeoWidgetBuilderUtil`** (new `UFUNCTION`s → full build):
   - `BuildAbilitySlotWidget(UWidgetBlueprint*, ...)` — builds `SizeBox → Overlay`: `Icon` (Image), `CooldownSweep` (Image w/ the material), `CountdownText` (centered Text), `CountText` (corner Text), optional `KeyHintText`. Names are the `BindWidget` targets.
   - `BuildAbilityBarWidget(UWidgetBlueprint*)` — root `HorizontalBox` named e.g. `SlotBox` for runtime population. (If preferred, the bar can stay a thin BP since a `HorizontalBox` root is trivial — but routing it through the shim keeps tree-building in one place and avoids the Python tree limitation.)
3. **Widget classes** (`UGeoUserWidget` subclasses, can be BP or thin C++ with `BindWidget`):
   - **`WBP_AbilitySlot`** — holds `FGeoAbilityBarEntry` + HUD ref; creates the `M_CooldownSweep` MID on init and assigns it to the `CooldownSweep` image brush. **Tick**: early-out unless on cooldown or `bIsDeployable`; else `HUD->GetAbilityCooldown` → set MID `Fill` + countdown text/visibility; `HUD->GetDeployCountForAbility` → set count text.
   - **`WBP_AbilityBar`** — on `InitAbilityBar`/`RefreshAbilityBar`: clear `SlotBox`, `HUD->GetAbilityBarEntries()`, create a `WBP_AbilitySlot` per entry into `SlotBox`, init each with entry + HUD ref. Bind `OnPlayerDeployCountChanged` to refresh badges.
4. Add `WBP_AbilityBar` into the existing player overlay BP, anchored **bottom-center** (top-left-only anchor + pixel offsets per `MCP_UI.md` "Fixed-Position Canvas Slot"). Implement `AGeoHUD::InitAbilityBar`/`RefreshAbilityBar` in the HUD BP to forward to it.
5. Populate `AbilityIcon` + `bShowDeployCount` on each `UAbilityInfo` entry (Python CDO/data-asset edit, `MCP_Blueprint.md`) for all player classes; Mine/Turret deploy abilities → `bShowDeployCount = true`.

### Reusable Python
Per `MCP/CLAUDE.md`, multi-step builds go in `AI/Python/*.py` (referenced by path, not pasted). Model the asset-creation + shim-call flow on `AI/Python/charge_beam_gauge.py` (widget BP creation + `BuildChargeBeamGaugeWidget` shim call) and `AI/Python/crosshair_cursor.py` (image-root shim usage). Add e.g. `AI/Python/ability_bar.py`.

## Files to modify
- `Source/GeoTrinity/Public/AbilitySystem/Data/AbilityInfo.h` — add `bShowDeployCount`.
- `Source/GeoTrinity/Public/HUD/GeoHUD.h` + `Private/HUD/GeoHUD.cpp` — `FGeoAbilityBarEntry`, the three helpers, `InitAbilityBar`/`RefreshAbilityBar` events, deploy-count delegate + binding.
- `Source/GeoTrinity/Private/Characters/PlayableCharacter.cpp` — refresh bar after `ChangeClass()`.
- `Source/GeoTrinity/Public/Tool/GeoWidgetBuilderUtil.h` + `.cpp` — new `BuildAbilitySlotWidget` / `BuildAbilityBarWidget` shim `UFUNCTION`s (editor-only; full build required).
- New assets (under `/Game/HUD/`): `WBP_AbilityBar`, `WBP_AbilitySlot`, material `M_CooldownSweep`; edits to player overlay BP, HUD BP, `UAbilityInfo` data asset.
- New Python: `AI/Python/ability_bar.py` (asset creation + shim calls).
- Docs to update after implementation (follow `MCP_DocStyle.md`): `AI/MCP/MCP_UI.md` (new ability-bar shim functions), `Source/GeoTrinity/Public/Tool/CLAUDE.md` (list the new `GeoWidgetBuilderUtil` functions), `Source/GeoTrinity/Public/HUD/CLAUDE.md` (ability-bar widgets + `AGeoHUD` helpers).

**Reuse:** `UAbilityInfo::GetAbilitiesForClass` / `GetAllPlayersAbilityInfos`, `UGeoGameplayAbility::GetAbilityTag` / `IsPassive`, native `GetCooldownTimeRemainingAndDuration`, `UGeoDeployableManagerComponent::GetDeployables<T>()` / `GetMaxDeployables()` / `OnDeployCountChanged`, `AGeoHUD::GetHudPlayerParams()`.

## Verification
1. Build via `AI/Commands.md` Bash build (mandatory after coding).
2. PIE (MCP `pie_control`): bottom-center row shows one icon per non-passive granted ability with correct art.
3. Fire a cooldown ability → radial sweeps + seconds count down, then clears. Cross-check with GasDebugger plugin ground-truth cooldown.
4. Deploy mines/turrets → count badge decrements; recall/expire → increments back (via `OnDeployCountChanged`, no polling).
5. `ChangeClass` → bar rebuilds with new class's abilities/icons.
6. Confirm no per-frame cost when all abilities ready (slot Tick early-outs).
